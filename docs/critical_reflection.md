# Critical reflection (Phase 2 — section 5.2)

## Strength (one)
- Example: Local-first RAG reduces hallucinations and supports sovereignty.

## Limitation (one)
- Example: The prototype uses a small corpus and a simple extractive response; real-world coverage requires official documents + better normalization/OCR.

## Improvement with more time (one specific)
- Example: Integrate official national APIs (status tracking) behind an internal gateway, and add a trust/traceability dashboard (citations, confidence, and audit logs).
